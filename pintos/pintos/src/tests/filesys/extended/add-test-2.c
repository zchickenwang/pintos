/* Test your buffer cacheâ€™s ability to coalesce writes
 * to the same sector. Each block device keeps a read_cnt
 * counter and a write_cnt counter. Write a large file
 * byte-by-byte (make the total file size at least 64KB,
 * which is twice the maximum allowed buffer cache size).
 * Then, read it in byte-by-byte. The total number of
 * device writes should be on the order of 128
 * (because 64KB is 128 blocks). */
